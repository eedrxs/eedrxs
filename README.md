### Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

Idris is a self-taught Web/Blockchain Engineer coming from a strong background in Graphics and Brand Identity Design. Ever since he made the bold move from design into tech over a year ago, his skills have rapidly expanded to cover a host of technologies in the frontend as well as in blockchain. He is actively expanding this skillset and building stuff the world needs along the way.

He is also a Technical Writer and an occasional poet. He does not wear a cape, but the ability to solve problems and make things work is his superpower.
