### Hi, there! 👋

### I'm a Fullstack Web and Blockchain developer:

1. I share the same name with a programming language (Idris).
2. People who use light-themed IDEs are not true programmers. 🌚


Here's what I'll be doing for the coming months:

1. Learning to work with React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Go, Solidity, Python, Rust etc.
2. Building my first Dapp.
3. Creating my first VS Code extension.
4. Working on a handful of unique project ideas.
5. And most importantly, graduating! 😁
