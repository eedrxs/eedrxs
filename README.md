### Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer coming from a strong background in Graphics and Brand Identity Design. Ever since I made the bold move from design into tech over a year ago, my skills have rapidly expanded to cover a host of technologies in the frontend as well as in blockchain. I am actively expanding this skillset and building stuff the world needs along the way.

I am also a Technical Writer and an occasional poet. I do not wear a cape, but the ability to solve problems and make things work is my superpower.
