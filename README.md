### Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Idris. I'm a passion-driven Frontend Engineer with 2+ years experience transforming ideas and specification into perfomant web end-products.

Pushed pixels for years as a Graphics Designer before finding my calling in Software Development where I currently combine the art of design and the science of programming in building crisp, eye-catching interfaces.

I am also a Technical Writer and an occasional poet. I do not wear a cape, but the ability to solve problems and make things work is my superpower.
